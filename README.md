# rexfactor

Adds automated code upgrades to REDAXO improving developer productivity and code quality.

The AddOn integrates [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) with the developer in mind, meaning it eases use for often used migration/upgrade use-cases. If you are a rector expert you don't need this AddOn. 

Primary purpose is to allow people less experienced with developer tooling to automate migration tasks.
